# Stat-432-Project

## Presentation (April 17 - May 1, 2019)
Each of the team will be given 12 minutes in class to present the project. Each team can have 2~3 (no more than 3) speakers to present your work. The presentation will be evaluated based on:

    Clarity: introduce the background, explain the motivation, challenge, and present the results and findings.
    Fluency: oral presentation.
    Pace: transition between speakers, no rush.
    Time-Control: no overtime.
    Technology (bonus): graphs, videos, demos, anything cool.

## Final Report
The final report of your analysis is due by Sunday, May 5, 11:59 PM. It should be submitted online via Compass by your group contact member.

As a group, you will submit files as you would for homework which include a .pdf/.html and .Rmd file. If your data is less than 10MB, you should submit the data too. Otherwise, you should provide a shared link to your actual cleaned R data (using, for example, google drive). Your report must contain the following:

    Project title
    Group Member Info
    Introduction and literature review (1 - 2 pages)
        Data source information (provide a link to your data source)
        You must have a comprehensive introduction of the data (no analysis) and the scientific goal
        You must review the literature (or relative sources) and report existing (possibly online) analyses results on this dataset
    Summary statistics and data visualization (less than 5 pages)
        You should provide a comprehensive summary of the data using tools we introduced
        Visualization is necessary for presenting the results
    Your proposed analysis (less than 10 pages)
        You should describe your approach and present your analysis results in a very comprehensive way
    Conclusion and discussion (1 - 2 pages)
        Summarize your scientific findings
        Address any potential pitfalls of your analysis, and discuss potential improvements (if you donâ€™t have enough time to implement them)
