# Introduction 

The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, also known as NCAA March Madness happens every year in spring. It features 68 college basketball teams from Division I level of the National Collegiate Atheletic Association (NCAA) to determine the national championship. March Madness was first created in 1939 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches and was pitched by Harold Olsen. And currently millions of people in America fill out a bracket to correctly predict the outcome of the entire event.

The format of the tournament are in rounds in the following order (taken from wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men's_Basketball_Tournament):

- The First Four
- The First Round (the Round of 64)
- The Second Round (the Round of 32)
- The Regional Semi-finals (participating teams are known popularly as the "Sweet Sixteen")
- The Regional Finals (participating teams are known commonly as the "Elite Eight")
- The National Semi-finals (participating teams are referred to officially as the "Final Four")
- The National Championship

The motivation behind this project is to correctly predict the outcome of a sports game. The ability to accurately predict the win/loss could help sports betting significantly. We will utilize the basketball game data, like the number of 2 pointers/3 pointers in a given game, to draw out useful information and provide insight on the outcome of each game, which is invaluable to sports bettors and viewers who just want to have a fun bet with friends. The data is from Kaggle Machine Learning Competition hosted by Google Cloud and NCAA 2018. It is a historical data collecting from year 1985 to 2018 (i.e. season 2017-2018, since this year's season is 2018-2019)[1].

In this project, the goal is to...[quantitative goal] by using ..... and determine which model gives the most accurate predictions in year 2018.

# Data Exploration

The original data from Kaggle Machine Learning Competitions had xx variables with xx observations. For this project, we have cleaned the dataset leaving us with xx variables and xx observations[2].

The dataset contains information about the regular season before the March Madness. Studies on the performance on regular seasons for the teams presented directly influences whether or not they make it to the March Madness itself. Therefore, we have conducted seasonal analysis and overall performance of each team. 

## Season Analysis 

How teams perform during regular seasons affect their chances of getting into the March Madness. In this part, we have analyzed the seasonal performance of the teams that have historically made it into March Madness. First, we explored the relationship between the location of the game with the percentage of wins. The goal here was to find if percentage of wins are associated with the location. 

![graph]("image link")

From looking at the graph, it is possible to witness 59.5% of the games won were at home while 30.6% were games won away. Neutral locations seem to be the worst options for teams to win, leaving 9.9% of the games won at this location. From this, we can see that locations may have a big impact in the chance of winning. 

## Team Analysis





# Data Modeling 
...goal
...approaches
...why this approach
...which had the best stats (MSE, RMSE, accuracy,etc) - result (model evaluation)

# Conclusion
..resulting conclusions from the modeling (i.e. who has more chance of winning than whom...)
..pitfalls of the analysis
..what needs to be improved

As a group, you will submit files as you would for homework which include a .pdf/.html and .Rmd file. If your data is less than 10MB, you should submit the data too. Otherwise, you should provide a shared link to your actual cleaned R data (using, for example, google drive). Your report must contain the following:

 A breakdown of the points for the final report (with total points of 100). Please note that these are only suggestions and minimal requirements. The instructor and TAs reserve the right for interpreting the rubrics.

> Grading
    (5%) Introduction and literature review:
        Provide enough background to the reader such that they can understand your goal without seeing the data
    (20%) Summary statistics and data visualization:
        Is your summary statistics correct and informative
        Is your visualization of the data correct and informative
    (20%) Use of statistical learning methodology:
        Have you used the appropriate methods for your dataset?
        Have you applied them correctly?
    (20%) Interpretation of statistical learning methodology:
        Do you arrive at the correct conclusions from the analyses you perform?
        Do you correctly interpreting the analyses results in terms of the original scientific problem
    (5%) Conclusion and discussion:
        Objectively summarize your findings and analysis experience
    (10%) Use of R:
        Does your code perform the desired task?
        Is your code readable?
    (10%) Use of R markdown:
        Are you properly utilizing R markdown to have a clean report?
        Is irrelevant code/output hidden?
        Are plots, tables, etc. properly displayed
    (10%) General Organization, Neatness, Readability:
        Is your report easy to read with clear logic
        Is it written in a manner such that a reader does not already need to be familiar with the data?
    **Bonus points* (1 - 10)
    This may be rewarded to project that analyzes an extremely complicated dataset.
