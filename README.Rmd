# Introduction 

The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, also known as NCAA March Madness happens every year in spring. It features 68 college basketball teams from Division I level of the National Collegiate Atheletic Association (NCAA) to determine the national championship. March Madness was first created in 1939 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches and was pitched by Harold Olsen. And currently millions of people in America fill out a bracket to correctly predict the outcome of the entire event.

The format of the tournament are in rounds in the following order (taken from wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men's_Basketball_Tournament):

- The First Four
- The First Round (the Round of 64)
- The Second Round (the Round of 32)
- The Regional Semi-finals (participating teams are known popularly as the "Sweet Sixteen")
- The Regional Finals (participating teams are known commonly as the "Elite Eight")
- The National Semi-finals (participating teams are referred to officially as the "Final Four")
- The National Championship

The motivation behind this project is to correctly predict the outcome of a sports game. The ability to accurately predict the win/loss could help sports betting significantly. We will utilize the basketball game data, like the number of 2 pointers/3 pointers in a given game, to draw out useful information and provide insight on the outcome of each game, which is invaluable to sports bettors and viewers who just want to have a fun bet with friends. The data is from Kaggle Machine Learning Competition hosted by Google Cloud and NCAA 2018. It is a historical data collecting from year 1985 to 2018 (i.e. season 2017-2018, since this year's season is 2018-2019)[1].

In this project, the goal is to...[quantitative goal] by using ..... and determine which model gives the most accurate predictions in year 2018.

# Data Exploration

The original data from Kaggle Machine Learning Competitions had xx variables with xx observations. For this project, we have cleaned the dataset leaving us with xx variables and xx observations[2].

The dataset contains information about the regular season before the March Madness. Studies on the performance on regular seasons for the teams presented directly influences whether or not they make it to the March Madness itself. Therefore, we have conducted seasonal analysis and overall performance of each team. 

## Season Analysis 

How teams perform during regular seasons affect their chances of getting into the March Madness. In this part, we have analyzed the seasonal performance of the teams that have historically made it into March Madness. First, we explored the relationship between the location of the game with the percentage of wins. The goal here was to find if percentage of wins are associated with the location. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
  RegularSeasonDetailedResults = read.csv("PrelimData2018/RegularSeasonDetailedResults_Prelim2018.csv")
  Teams = read.csv("DataFiles/Teams.csv")
  library(plyr)
  library(ggplot2)
  # calculate frequency
  loc_freq = count(RegularSeasonDetailedResults$WLoc)
  
  # calculate percentage and round to 2sf
  loc_freq['percentage'] = 100/sum(loc_freq$freq)*loc_freq$freq
  loc_freq['percentage_r'] <- signif(loc_freq$percentage, digits = 3)
  
  # calculate center of each segment for label
  loc_freq['pos'] <- cumsum(loc_freq$percentage) - loc_freq$percentage/2
  # set levels for segments so can order to match labels
  loc_freq$x <- factor(loc_freq$x, levels = rev(loc_freq$x))
  
  # pie chart
  ggplot(loc_freq, aes(x="", y=percentage_r, fill = x))+
    geom_bar(stat="identity")+coord_polar("y")+
    ggtitle("% of games won at each location")+
    geom_text(aes(y=pos, label=percentage_r))+theme(
      axis.title.x = element_blank(),
      axis.title.y = element_blank(),
      axis.ticks = element_blank(),
      axis.text = element_blank(),
      panel.border = element_blank(),
      panel.grid = element_blank()
    )
```
From looking at the graph, it is possible to witness 59.5% of the games won were at home while 30.6% were games won away. Neutral locations seem to be the worst options for teams to win, leaving 9.9% of the games won at this location. From this, we can see that locations may have a big impact in the chance of winning. 

## Team Analysis

Teams can be evaluated in terms of (1) goals they score in average or (2) win percentage across seasons. First, we considered the win percentage across the regular season. The questions that could be answered from this analysis are: who are the top 34 teams that frequently wins the game in the regular seasons? Are they ones who make it to the March Madness most frequently? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# win freq
team_Wfreq = count(RegularSeasonDetailedResults$WTeamID)
team_Wfreq$x = as.factor(team_Wfreq$x)
# lose freq
team_Lfreq = count(RegularSeasonDetailedResults$LTeamID)
team_Lfreq$x  = as.factor(team_Lfreq$x)
# rename common name to merge
colnames(team_Wfreq)[1] = "TeamID"
colnames(team_Lfreq)[1] = "TeamID"
team_Wfreq = merge(team_Wfreq, Teams, by = "TeamID")
win_freq = merge(team_Wfreq,team_Lfreq, by = "TeamID")
final_frequency = win_freq[-4:-5]
colnames(final_frequency)[2] = "Win"
colnames(final_frequency)[4] = "Lose"
# calculate win percentage
final_frequency["percentage"] = (100 / (final_frequency$Win + final_frequency$Lose)) * final_frequency$Win
final_frequency$TeamID <- as.factor(final_frequency$TeamID)
final_frequency$TeamID <- factor(final_frequency$TeamID, levels = final_frequency$TeamID[order(final_frequency$percentage)])
## Question: What are top 34 teams? 
top.teams = head(final_frequency[order(-final_frequency$percentage),], n=34)
## Question: What are worst 34 teams?
bottom.teams = head(final_frequency[order(final_frequency$percentage),], n=34)
# plot
 ggplot(top.teams, aes(x=TeamName, y=percentage)) +
  ylim(0, 100) +
  ggtitle("Top 34 teams % of games won") +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  xlab("Team Name") + theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1)
  )
```

By goals they scores in average...
```{r, echo = FALSE}
Wscores = as.data.frame(RegularSeasonDetailedResults$WTeamID)
colnames(Wscores)[1] = "TeamID"
Wscores["Score"] = RegularSeasonDetailedResults$WScore
Lscores = as.data.frame(RegularSeasonDetailedResults$LTeamID)
colnames(Lscores)[1] = "TeamID"
Lscores["Score"] = RegularSeasonDetailedResults$LScore
AllScores = cbind(Wscores,Lscores)
# calculate team with highest score
AggScores = aggregate(Score ~ TeamID, AllScores,FUN="mean")
AggScores = merge(AggScores, Teams, by = "TeamID")
AggScores$TeamID = as.factor(AggScores$TeamID)
AggScores$TeamID = factor(AggScores$TeamID, levels = AggScores$TeamID[order(AggScores$Score)])
AggScores = AggScores[,-4:-5]
# Top 34 scoring teams
head(AggScores[order(-AggScores$Score), ], n=34)
# Worst 34 scoring teams
head(AggScores[order(AggScores$Score), ], n=34)
```
